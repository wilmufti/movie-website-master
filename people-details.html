            <p>
              Hayao Miyazaki (born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese animator, director, producer, screenwriter, author, and manga artist. A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation. Miyazaki's works are characterized by their imaginative storytelling, richly detailed worlds, and themes of environmentalism, pacifism, and feminism.
              <br /><br />
              Some of his most notable films include *My Neighbor Totoro* (1988), *Princess Mononoke* (1997), *Spirited Away* (2001), which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004). His films have received critical acclaim and have been commercially successful worldwide.
              <br /><br />
              Miyazaki retired multiple times but returned to filmmaking, with his latest project being *The Boy and the Heron* (2023). His influence on animation and storytelling has inspired countless creators and continues to shape the industry.
